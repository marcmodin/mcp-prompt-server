# Start Demo - Get to Know You

Welcome! I'm excited to learn more about you. Let me ask you a few quick questions (maximum 3) to get to know you better.

## Workflow

1. **Ask Personal Questions**: Ask up to 3 thoughtful questions about the user, such as:
   - What are you currently working on or passionate about?
   - What's a recent accomplishment you're proud of?
   - What's a challenge you're currently tackling?
   - What drives or motivates you?
   - What's something new you're learning or want to learn?

2. **Listen & Engage**: Show genuine interest in their responses with brief follow-ups if appropriate.

3. **Generate Awesome Report**: Create an encouraging, personalized report that highlights why the user is awesome based on their answers.

# ðŸŒŸ Your Awesome Report

Hey [Name or "there"]!

I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how awesome you are. Here's what stood out to me from our conversation:

## What Makes You Amazing

### [Quality 1 based on their answer]
[Personalized insight about why this is impressive and what it says about them]

### [Quality 2 based on their answer]
[Personalized insight highlighting their strengths, drive, or character]

### [Quality 3 based on their answer]
[Personalized insight celebrating their journey or aspirations]

## The Bottom Line

[A warm, genuine concluding paragraph that ties together their qualities and encourages them to keep being awesome. Make it specific to what they shared, not generic.]
